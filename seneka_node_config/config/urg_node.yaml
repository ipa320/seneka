#~ip_address (string, default: "")
#Location of the device on the network (only valid for ethernet devices).
#If this is left blank or is the empty string, the driver assumes the device is serial and will only attempt to connect using the '~serial_port' and '~serial_baud' parameters. 
ip_address: '192.168.0.10'

#~ip_port (int, default: 10940)
#IP port number. (1 to 65535) 
#ip_port:

#~frame_id (string, default: laser)
#The frame in which laser scans will be returned.
#This frame should be at the optical center of the laser, with the x-axis along the zero degree ray, and the y-axis along the 90 degree ray. 
frame_id: 'link_laser'

#~calibrate_time (bool, default: false)
#Whether the node should calibrate the device's time offset on startup.
#If true, the node will exchange of series of messages with the device in order to determine the time delay in the connection.
#This calibration step is necessary to produce accurate timestamps on scans. 
#calibrate_time:

#~time_offset (double, default: 0.0)
#A manually calibrated offset (in seconds) to add to the timestamp before publication of a message. 
#time_offset:

#~publish_intensity (bool, default: false)
#If true, the laser will publish intensity.
#If false, the laser will not publish intensity to save bandwidth.
#Should be implemented in hardware if possible, but otherwise may be implemented in software. 
#publish_intensity:

#~publish_multiecho (bool, default: false)
#If true, a multiecho laserscanner will publish sensor_msgs/MultiEchoLaserScan.
#If false, the laser will publish sensor_msgs/LaserScan.
#(If supported by the hardware; otherwise, please use a support library to convert MultiEchoLaserScans to LaserScans.)
#This parameter is only valid for multiecho laserscanners. 
publish_multiecho: false

#~angle_min (double, default: -&pi)
#Controls the angle of the first range measurement in radians.
#(If supported by the hardware; it is not recommended to implement this feature in software.) 
#angle_min:

#~angle_max (double, default: &pi)
#Controls the angle of the last range measurement in radians.
#(If supported by the hardware; it is not recommended to implement this feature in software.) 
#angle_max:

#~cluster (int, default: 1)
#The number of adjacent range measurements to cluster into a single reading; the shortest reading from the cluster is reported.
#(If supported by the hardware; it is not recommended to implement this feature in software.) 
#cluster:

#~skip (int, default: 0)
#The number of input messages to skip between each output message.
#The device will publish 1 message for every N skipped messages.
#Example: if skip is set to '2', the device will publish 1 message and then 'drop' the following 2 message - a 66.7% reduction in output rate. 
#(If supported by the hardware; it is not recommended to implement this feature in software.)
#skip:
